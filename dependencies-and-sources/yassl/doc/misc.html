<h2>Thread Safety</h2>
</span>
<span class="bodyText">
yaSSL is thread safe by design.  Multiple threads can enter the library
simultaneously without creating conflicts because yaSSL avoids global data,
static data, and the sharing of objects.  The user must still take care to
avoid potential problems in two areas.

<p>A client may share an SSL object across multiple threads but access must be
synchronized, i.e., trying to read/write at the same time from two different
threads with the same SSL pointer is not supported.

<p>yaSSL could take a more aggressive (constrictive) stance and lock out other
users when a function is entered that cannot be shared but this level of
granularity seems counterintuitive, all users (even single threaded ones)
will pay for the locking and multi-thread ones won't be able to re-enter the
library even if they aren't sharing objects across threads.  This penalty seems
much too high and yaSSL leaves the responsibility of synchronizing shared
objects in the hands of the user.

<p>Besides sharing SSL pointers, users must also take care to completely
initialize an SSL_CTX before passing the structure to <i>SSL_new()</i>.  The
same SSL_CTX can create multiple SSLs but the SSL_CTX is only read during
<i>SSL_new()</i> creation and any future (or simultaneous changes) to the
SSL_CTX will not be reflected once the SSL object is created.

<p>Again, multiple threads should synchronize writing access to a SSL_CTX and it
is advised that a single thread initialize the SSL_CTX to avoid the
synchronization and update problem described above.

<p>Update: See note below about Session Caching and Multiple Threads.

<h2>Session Caching</h2>
</span>
<span class="bodyText">
yaSSL now supports session caching which can greatly decrease the connection
processing time when clients re-issue connects within a relatively short time
(the default is to cache for 500 seconds). Access to the cache is internally
stored in yaSSL with a Singleton and is the only part of the library which
isn't thread safe.  For users that aren't multi-threaded or don't plan on
using session caching and don't want to pay for the locking of this cache,
please define SINGLE_THREADED when compiling yaSSL.

<a name="memory">
<span class="pageName">
<h2>Memory</h2>
</span>
<span class="bodyText">
yaSSL doesn't pre-allocate any memory up front for a connection.  This allows
users to create a large pool of connection objects without paying for a large
memory hit.  yaSSL only requests memory when it needs it, and returns it to the
system when it no longer needs it. 

yaSSL requires about 32K of memory for a connection (this includes 6K for 3
certificates, and the total will vary depending on certificate size and number
as well as the type of connection).

After that, yaSSL only requires about 500 bytes of memory to send or receive
an SSL message.

Users wishing to pre-allocate memory, or take over the memory handling in any
way, can implement their own ::operator new and delete.

<h2>No C++</h2>
</span>
<span class="bodyText">
yaSSL is implemented in C++.  For those users wishing to use a version of yaSSL
without any global C++ symbols, there is a way to achieve this using GCC.  Just
define YASSL_PURE_C when building yaSSL.  No exceptions, RTTI, std library, or
global allocators will be defined.
