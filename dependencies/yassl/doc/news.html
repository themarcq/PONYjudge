<h3>yaSSL/CaySSL have no renegotiaton vulnerability</h3>
</span>
<span class="bodyText">
<p> (11/12/2009)

<p>Hi!  We've been getting a number of questions about the high profile
vulnerabilities in OpenSSL, GnuTLS, NSS and mod_ssl.

<p>This vulnerability is based on a potentially insecure SSL early feature that
yaSSL chose to never support in the first place.  As such, yaSSL/CyaSSL was
never insecure.

<p>More details on the issue can be found below: From <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3555">CVE</a>

<p>"The TLS protocol, and the SSL protocol 3.0 and possibly earlier, as used in
Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.0, mod_ssl in the Apache HTTP
Server 2.2.14 and earlier, OpenSSL before 0.9.8l, GnuTLS 2.8.5 and earlier,
       Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) 3.12.4 and earlier, and other products,
       does not properly associate renegotiation handshakes with an existing
       connection, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert data into HTTPS
       sessions, and possibly other types of sessions protected by TLS or SSL, by
       sending an unauthenticated request that is processed retroactively by a server
       in a post-renegotiation context, related to a "plaintext injection" attack, aka
       the "Project Mogul" issue."

<h3>CyaSSL Release 1.2.0</h3>
</span>
<span class="bodyText">
<p> (11/2/2009) The CyaSSL embedded ssl library Release 1.2.0 is now available for download.

<p>Release 1.2.0 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes and session negotiation when first
use is read or write.

<p> To get TLS 1.2 support please use the client and server functions:

<p>SSL_METHOD *TLSv1_2_server_method(void);
<p>SSL_METHOD *TLSv1_2_client_method(void);

<p>The CyaSSL OpenSSL compatibility layer was tested against lighttpd 1.4.23,
 see the notes in README for build instructions. See the download page for a
 build of Lighty built with CyaSSL.

<h3>CyaSSL Release 1.0.6</h3>
</span>
<span class="bodyText">
<p> (8/3/2009) The CyaSSL embedded ssl library Release 1.0.6 is now available for download.

<p>Release 1.0.6 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes, an improved session cache, and
faster math with a huge code option.

<p>The session cache now defaults to a client mode, also good for embedded
servers.  For servers not under heavy load (less than 200 new sessions per
minute), define BIG_SESSION_CACHE.  If the server will be under heavy load,
define HUGE_SESSION_CACHE.

<p>There is now a fasthugemath option for configure.  This enables fastmath
plus even faster math by greatly increasing the code size of the math library.
Use the benchmark utility to compare public key operations.

<p> (5/10/2009) The CyaSSL embedded ssl library Release 1.0.3 is now available for download.
Release 1.0.3 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes and increases OpenSSL compatibility
support for building other applications.

<p>Release 1.0.3 includes an alpha release of DTLS for both client and servers.
This is only for testing purposes at this time.  Rebroadcast and reordering
aren't fully implemented at this time but will be for the next release.

<p> (4/2/2009) The CyaSSL embedded ssl library Release 1.0.2 is now available for download.
Release 1.0.2 for CyaSSL adds bug fixes for a couple I/O issues. Some systems
will send a SIGPIPE on socket recv() at any time and this should be handled by
the application by turning off SIGPIPE through setsockopt() or returning from
the handler.

<p>Release 1.0.2 includes an alpha release of DTLS for both client and servers.
This is only for testing purposes at this time.  Rebroadcast and reordering
